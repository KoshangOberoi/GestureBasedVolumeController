# GestureBasedVolumeController
GUI based application for controlling device volume using hand gesture
Below are some of the screen shots of my implementation:

At the top left corner we have the current frame rate. Below that we display the volume (not the original) as recognized by the hand gesture. And at the bottom right is the current system volume.

Once we put down our pinkie, the original volume start to change as the displayed volume.
